            My interest in web development, and by extension full stack software
            engineering, didn't come to me until late into my junior year at
            university. Since then I have been learning new frameworks and tools
            to further expand my skills.

          <p className="contentAbout">
            Currently, I am on a team for our senior project involving a web
            (and hopefully desktop) application that allows for student
            collaboration on a completely new scale. Workspace and community
            applications tend to overlook a student focused approach. I hope to
            fill in that gap and provide a great platform for students to
            utilize in their academic lives.

            During my brief moments of respite, which are sadly far and few in
            between, I like to watch videos on oddities (cryptids, liminal
            spaces, etc.) write poetry and short stories, and play games! My
            current obsessoin has been Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty.
